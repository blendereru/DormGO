## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with SwiftUI for the user interface and Combine for reactive data binding.

## Setup for the app
    ‚Ä¢ Xcode (version 15 or later)
    ‚Ä¢ macOS (version 12 or later)

## üì¶ Dependencies
    ‚Ä¢ Combine: Reactive programming framework for data binding.
    ‚Ä¢ CoreLocation: For location services and retrieving the user‚Äôs location.
    ‚Ä¢ MapKit: For map view and geolocation-related functionality.
    ‚Ä¢ SignalRClient: For websocket implementation
## Endpoints
`Server-side` defines multiple `endpoints` for client to send requests to. 
* `HttpPost /api/signup` - is needed to register new user in a database
* `/api/userhub?userName=<your_userName>` - this is where the client and the server set connection with hub(SignalR).
This endpoint is needed to notify the client when the user confirms his email.
* `/api/confirm-email` - is needed to confirm user's email.
* `HttpPost /api/signin` - is needed to log an existing user in the system. Doesn't allow to sign in until the `email` is confirmed.
### Endpoints for authorized users `only`
* `HttpPost /api/post/create` - the endpoint to create a `post` and make it visible for all users.
* `HttpPost /api/post/update/{id}` - is needed to update the post info.
* `HttpGet /api/post/read/{id}` - is needed to retrieve the information about specific post.
* `HttpPost /api/post/join/{id}` - is needed to join the specific post. Marks the current user as a `member`.
* `HttpPost /api/post/delete/{id}` - is needed to delete the specified post.
* `HttpGet /api/post/read` - to read all posts.
* `HttpGet /api/post/read/others` - is needed to retrieve the posts that user joined.
* `/api/posthub` - is needed to notify `all the connected clients` about the post that was created.

## üö® Requirements
To use this project, ensure the following requirements are met:
1. A running instance of `SQL Server` (local or remote). Update the `ConnectionStrings:IdentityConnection` in the
`appsettings.json` file with your `SQL Server` details:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "IdentityConnection": "Data Source=your-server-name;Initial Catalog=your-database-name;Integrated Security=True;"
}
```
2. Register your application with `Google` to enable `OAuth2` login. Obtain your `ClientId` and `ClientSecret` from the `Google Cloud Console` and
update the following section in `appsettings.json`:
```json
"GoogleServices": {
  "ClientId": "your-client-id",
  "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret"
}
```
3. Configure `email` settings for sending confirmation emails. Use a valid `SMTP` provider such as `Gmail`. Then
update the `EmailSettings` section in the `appsettings.json` file:
```json
"EmailSettings": {
  "MailServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "MailPort": 587,
  "SenderName": "email-identity",
  "FromEmail": "your-email@gmail.com",
  "Password": "your-email-password"
}
```
If you're using Gmail, use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

4. If you want to test the API by running it on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/),
you have to pass your secrets to the following files:
* [compose file](https://github.com/blendereru/LoginForm/blob/1c92e0acf566d70069fcfa99a24913562baa6e65/compose.yaml): 
```yaml
environment:
  - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
  - MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=<your_password>
```
* appsettings:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "IdentityConnection": "Server=db, 1433;Database=dormgo-db;User Id=sa;Password=<your_password>;TrustServerCertificate=true"
}
```
## üéØ ToDos
1. [ ] Add endpoints to handle the case when user's data changes. For example, client forgot his `password`.
2. [ ] Modify the `UI` for better appearance.
3. [ ] Chat functions so that members of the post can talk to each other.
